The FMI thresholds employed in this study (F/M = 0.75, 1.0, 1.25) apply the Gulland (1971) heuristic uniformly across all life histories. However, life history theory predicts that long-lived, low-productivity species require more conservative exploitation thresholds than fast-turnover species (Zhou et al. 2012; Froese 2004). Our validation results support this prediction: 85% of long-lived stocks (M < 0.2) breached the danger threshold at some point in their time series, compared to only 22% of fast-turnover stocks (M ≥ 0.8). This disparity suggests that either (a) long-lived species are systematically overfished relative to their biology, or (b) the universal threshold is too lenient for slow species and too conservative for fast species. Future work should derive empirically optimized, life-history-specific thresholds to improve predictive accuracy across the full spectrum of exploited taxa.

### Limitations

The Caprazli FMI framework, as presented here, employs universal exploitation thresholds derived from the classical Gulland (1971) relationship F = M. While this provides a biologically grounded anchor point—mathematically equivalent to the widely-used E = 0.5 threshold—it does not account for the substantial variation in sustainable exploitation rates across life histories.

Life history theory predicts that species with low natural mortality, slow growth, and late maturation (e.g., elasmobranchs, deep-water rockfish) have intrinsically lower population growth rates and thus reduced capacity to sustain fishing pressure compared to fast-turnover species with high M (e.g., small pelagics, squid). This suggests that optimal F/M ratios should diverge rather than remain parallel: long-lived species may require F/M < 0.5, while highly productive species may tolerate F/M > 1.5 without compromising sustainability.

Our forensic validation results are consistent with this theoretical expectation. Among the 344 stocks analyzed, 85% of long-lived stocks (M < 0.2) breached the danger threshold (FMI > 1.25) at least once, compared to only 22% of fast-turnover stocks (M ≥ 0.8). The mean maximum FMI was 6.54 for long-lived stocks versus 1.15 for fast-turnover stocks—a six-fold difference that cannot be attributed to chance alone.

Two interpretations are possible: (1) global fisheries systematically overexploit long-lived species relative to their biology, or (2) the universal FMI threshold is inappropriately calibrated across life histories. Both interpretations carry important management implications and warrant further investigation.

Future work should employ ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) analysis to derive empirically optimized, life-history-specific F/M thresholds that maximize sensitivity and specificity for predicting stock collapse across each life history category. Such refinement would transform the FMI from a universal diagnostic into a taxonomically-tuned early warning system.
